        <li><strong>Rolled oats</strong>- These are the traditional ones, also known as old-fashioned oats or even porridge oats.  You could use jumbo oats instead, but it will give a chunkier texture.</li>
        <li><storng>Vanilla protein powder</storng>- Always choose a good quality one with no added sugars or artificial sweeteners.  If you already have a favorite that isn’t vanilla flavored, that’s absolutely fine; you could always use that.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut butter</strong>- cookies are sweet enough, so steer clear of jars with added sugars and opt for the natural ones. </li>
        <p>You could always use another nut butter of your choice, too; almond is particularly good. And if you don’t have a smooth one?  Just switch to a crunchy variety.</p>

        <li><strong>Maple syrup</strong>- There are many different maple syrups to choose from that come from various maple trees, so use your favorite.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocao powder</strong>- The raw cacao powder, made from fermented, unroasted cacao beans, has the least processing, so considered to be the healthiest, so it’s worth looking out for that.</li>
        <li><strong>
        </strong>Cinnamon</strong>- You could use a little warming ground ginger here if you wanted to switch the flavors a little.  Any ground cinnamon would be good here.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutmeg</strong>- Try and freshly grind this yourself as the flavor and aromas are far superior to the ready ground versions.  You can omit it altogether if you like, but it’s a tasty addition!</li>
        <li><strong>Sea salt</strong>- You can use regular table salt here if you wish, but sea salt has minimal processing and is higher in some minerals.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>- Look for one that has minimal added sugar, syrups, or caramel coloring for the best quality and taste.</li>
